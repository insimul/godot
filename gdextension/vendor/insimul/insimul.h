/*
 * VENDORED — verbatim copy of libinsimul's shipping header.
 *
 *   source:  insimul-native (`native/`) include/insimul.h
 *   commit:  a9287b579c2f998f78ef94c5f19bc3290dc397a2
 *   version: libinsimul 0.1.0 (trealla v2.106.1)
 *   by:      tasklist 100 US-2, the first story to LINK the real library rather
 *            than syntax-gate against a hand-written contract copy.
 *
 * What was here before was a hand-written approximation, and it was wrong on
 * three counts that only linking could expose (RUNTIME_CORE_ADOPTION.md §6.6):
 *   1. it documented "1 on success, 0 on error" for the mutating calls; the
 *      library returns **0 on success, -1 on error** (and retract returns 1 for
 *      "nothing matched"). insimul_prolog.cpp had believed the copy and
 *      inverted every result;
 *   2. it said insimul_last_error() returns "" when clear; it returns NULL;
 *   3. it did not say that assert/retract take term text WITHOUT a trailing
 *      full stop.
 *
 * Re-copy this file when libinsimul's ABI moves. Do not edit it in place.

#ifndef INSIMUL_H
#define INSIMUL_H

/*
 * insimul.h — the stable C ABI for libinsimul, the shared native Prolog core
 * used by the Unreal, Unity, and Godot engine plugins.
 *
 * INVARIANT: this header includes no Trealla (or any other engine) headers and
 * leaks no engine types. The Prolog engine is an implementation detail behind
 * this opaque, extern "C" boundary, so the engine can be swapped later without
 * breaking the wrappers that parse this contract.
 *
 * THREAD MODEL: one insimul_kb is owned by one thread. There is no global
 * mutable state shared across KBs, so a host may run N independent KBs on N
 * threads (required for Unity/Unreal). A single KB, its queries, and its error
 * string must not be touched concurrently from more than one thread.
 *
 * OWNERSHIP / STRINGS: every `const char *` returned by this ABI is owned by the
 * object it came from (the kb for insimul_last_error, the query for
 * insimul_query_next) and stays valid until that object is destroyed/stopped or
 * a later call on the same object replaces it (see each function). Callers copy
 * anything they need to keep; they never free a returned pointer.
 *
 * ERROR REPORTING: mutating calls return an int status (see each function).
 * Whenever a call reports failure, insimul_last_error(kb) returns a human/machine
 * readable message (the caught Prolog exception term, quoted). A successful call
 * clears it back to NULL.
